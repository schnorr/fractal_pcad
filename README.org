* Fractal @ PCAD

We'll keep here our efforts for the "UFRGS Portas Abertas". Our idea
is to run an enourmous fractal in an interactive manner for our
visitors at the Informatics Institute data center.

People involved:
- Prof. Lucas Mello Schnorr ([[https://github.com/schnorr][@schnorr]])
- Rayan Raddatz de Matos ([[https://github.com/rddtz][@rddtz]])
- Francisco Pegoraro Etcheverria ([[https://github.com/thedoubleace][@thedoubleace]])
- Kenichi Brumati ([[https://github.com/Kenichi220][@Kenichi220]])

If you want to get yourself involved, get in touch. ;-)

** Interacting with the fractal

You can go further in the fractal by selecting a new zone to zoom in
when in selection mode. You can enter selection mode by pressing =ENTER=.

| KEY                       | FUNCTION                                             |
|---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| ENTER                     | Enters "Selection Mode"                              |
| BACKSPACE                 | Exits "Selection Mode"                               |
| ENTER (in selection mode) | Sends current selected area as next payload          |
| G +                       | Increase the granularity                             |
| G -                       | Decrease the granularity                             |
| P +                       | Increase the depth of the fractal                    |
| P -                       | Decrease the depth of the fractal                    |
| ARROWKEYS / WASD *        | Move selection box                                   |
| S-UPARROW or S-w *        | Increase selection box size                          |
| S-DOWNARROW or S-s *      | Decrease selection box size                          |
| Space                     | Change the actual color mode                         |
| c                         | Show the workers colors within the actual color mode |
| C-z **                    | Go back to the previous payload                      |

When in selection mode, you can also move the box using the mouse by
left clicking the selection box and draggin it. And also change it's
size with the mouse scroll.

*You can hold "CONTROLÂ¨ to move the box or change it's size with precision.
**C stands for "CONTROL" and S stands for "SHIFT".
