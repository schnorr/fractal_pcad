* Fractal @ PCAD

We'll keep here our efforts for the "UFRGS Portas Abertas". Our idea
is to run an enourmous fractal in an interactive manner for our
visitors at the Informatics Institute data center.

People involved:
- Prof. Lucas Mello Schnorr (@schnorr)
- Rayan Raddatz de Matos (@rddtz)

If you want to get yourself involved, get in touch quickly. ;-)
